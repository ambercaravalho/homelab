# macOS Configuration

macOS sucks and should never be used as a server platform. _That being said_, I've picked it as my OS of choice. 

Let's just say this was purposeful because of its [excellent performance per watt](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/m4-mac-minis-efficiency-incredible) stats and call it a day.

### In no particular order, here are some config docs:

- [AltServer Sideloading](/macos/altserver/README.md)
- [Brew Package Manager](/macos/brew/README.md)
- [Colima Container Runtime](/macos/colima/README.md)
- [Disk Utility RAID](/macos/disk_utility/README.md)
- [Ollama LLM Server](/macos/ollama/README.md)
- [Pegasus External DAS](/macos/pegasus/README.md)
- [Plex Media Server](/macos/plex/README.md)
- [System Settings](/macos/system_settings/README.md)

_and don't forget, there's always more to do! ðŸ˜˜_
