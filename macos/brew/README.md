# Homebrew Package Manager

I use the [Brew.sh](https://brew.sh) package manager to install applications and their dependencies. _yay, linux package management on darwin!_

### 1. Install Script (run in macos terminal)

``` bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Application Installs

``` bash
brew install altserver appcleaner colima docker docker-completion docker-compose docker-credential-helper ollama plex-media-server
```

_**note to self**: plz try to use brew for any installs to make processes repeatable in the future. thx!_
