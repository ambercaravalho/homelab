# AltServer

Why in the hell is it so hard to sideload apps on iOS devices? Apple really is that [meme](https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/24/8490711/google-android-apple-robot-apologize) sometimes. Anyways, the community always [provides](https://github.com/altstoreio/AltStore).

### 1. Install

1. Install Ollama using Brew **first**: [brew](/macos/brew/README.md)

2. Then follow the guide: [How to Install (macOS)](https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/how-to-install-altstore-macos)

### 2. Pebble!

The only reason I'm even using AltServer is so I can still use my Pebble! Still can't believe it's [coming back](https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back). In the meantime, however, we gotta sideload the super old original IPA.

Read more about what I've done to this IPA file and how I'd add new device support down the line on [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/ambercaravalho/63ec05a24652e7da6f7bd89d495aaa65).
