# Docker Configuration

Container orchestration for the homelab! Everything here runs on [standalone Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/standalone/) because complexity is overrated.

_I swear I'll start migrating to [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) or [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) eventually, but that feels like a lot of work._ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
